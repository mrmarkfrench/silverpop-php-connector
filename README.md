silverpop-php-connector
=======================

A connector SDK library for applications integrating with Silverpop, including the Universal Behavior API.

Latest Version
--------------

The latest version is 1.2.2, and can be found in the version_1 branch. If you'd prefer the latest ongoing development version, it's in the master branch.

Quickstart
----------

* Clone the silverpop-php-connector repository to your local machine, or download and extract the ZIP archive.
* Copy the authDataSample.ini file, fill in the credentials for your Silverpop account, and save the file as "authData.ini"
* Run the apiTest.php script

Contributions and Adding Functionality
--------------------------------------

The SDK currently supports only a subset of the API endpoints offered by Silverpop. New endpoints are added as the primary author's projects need them, but you are welcome to add your own! If your project requires an endpoint not yet supported, please feel free to fork this repository and add functions as necessary. The existing functions should give you a solid framework to build on, and your pull requests are welcome.
